# Agent Guidelines

Before starting to think, read the README to understand the project.

## Code Comments Guidelines

**Avoid redundant comments:**

- Do NOT write comments that simply restate what the code obviously does
- Do NOT write comments that describe the structure (e.g., `{/* Header */}`, `// Footer section`)
- Do NOT write changelog-style comments (e.g., `// Added 2024-01-01`, `// Fixed bug`)

**Write comments only when:**

- Explaining WHY something is done (not WHAT is done)
- Documenting non-obvious business logic or algorithms
- Clarifying complex or counterintuitive code
- Providing context that cannot be expressed in code

**Prefer self-documenting code:**

- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Extract complex logic into well-named functions
- Structure code to be readable without comments
