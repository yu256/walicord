The project 'walicord' is a Discord bot designed for splitting bills or expenses within a Discord channel. It uses a custom syntax to parse messages, record debts, and calculate the optimal way to settle them. Users can declare members in a channel's topic, and then record expenses in the chat. The bot provides commands to view the current state and to trigger the final settlement calculation. The project also includes a command-line interpreter for offline testing and execution of the same logic.
